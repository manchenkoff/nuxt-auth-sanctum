# Breeze Nuxt template

Suppose you want to start a fresh project based on Nuxt and Laravel Sanctum with the Breeze API kit.&#x20;

In that case, you may consider trying out the template repository that has implemented all authentication logic and contains several pages such as:

* Landing
* Login
* Sign up
* Password reset
* Dashboard

The repository is available here - [breeze-nuxt](https://github.com/manchenkoff/breeze-nuxt), follow the guide in `readme.md` to set up Laravel API and connect it to the front-end application.

Also, it uses the Nuxt UI module that allows you to start building complex interfaces with ease thanks to predefined components and Tailwind CSS. For more details, check the repository.

As for the backend API part, we have you covered as well - check our [breeze-api](https://github.com/manchenkoff/breeze-api) template.
