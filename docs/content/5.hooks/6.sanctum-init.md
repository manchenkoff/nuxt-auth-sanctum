## Usage

Our module registers a plugin which requests a user identity once an application is started. 
This is needed for middleware and redirects to properly function.

Subscribe to the `sanctum:init` hook which triggers once the identity request is completed.

```typescript [app/plugins/sanctum-listener.ts]
export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.hook('sanctum:init', () => {
    console.log('Sanctum init hook triggered')
  })
})
```

::warning
Keep in mind, since `nuxt-auth-sanctum` is loaded before any other module/plugin, 
you might need to configure your own plugin and set dependencies as described in 
[Plugin dependencies](/advanced/dependencies).
::

Here is what the hook looks like

```typescript
interface RuntimeNuxtHooks {
 /**
  * Triggers when an initial user identity request has been made.
  */
 'sanctum:init': () => HookResult
}
```
