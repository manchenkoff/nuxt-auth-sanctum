This module provides a simple way to use Laravel Sanctum with Nuxt. SSR-ready!

## Key Features

This module includes a range of features designed to streamline authentication:

- `useSanctumAuth` composable for easy access to the current user and authentication methods
- `useSanctumFetch` and `useLazySanctumFetch` to load data from your API
- Automated `CSRF` token header and cookie management
- Automated `Bearer` token header management
- Both `CSR` and `SSR` modes support
- Pre-configured middleware for pages that require authentication
- Cast current user information to any class you want
- Custom `request` and `response` interceptors
- Subscribe to `sanctum:*` hooks to react as you want
- Compatible with default Nuxt `ofetch` client
- TypeScript support
- ... and more, check the docs!
