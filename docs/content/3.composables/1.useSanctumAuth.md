## Usage

Composable provides 2 computed properties and 4 methods:

- `user` - currently authenticated user (basically the same as `useSanctumUser`)
- `isAuthenticated` - a boolean flag indicating whether the user is authenticated or not
- `login` - method for logging in the user
- `logout` - method for logging out the user
- `refreshIdentity` - method for manually re-fetching current authenticated user data
- `checkSession` - method to validate existence of the session (cookie in the browser or token in the storage) 

To authenticate a user you should pass the credentials payload as an argument to the `login` method. 
The payload should contain all fields required by your Laravel Sanctum backend.

```typescript
const { login } = useSanctumAuth();

const userCredentials = {
    email: 'user@mail.com',
    password: '123123',
};

await login(userCredentials);
```

If the login operation was successful, the `user` property will be updated with 
the current user information returned by the Laravel API.

By default, methods will use the following Laravel endpoints:
- `/login` to authenticate the user
- `/logout` to log out the user
- `/api/user` to get the current user information
- `/sanctum/csrf-cookie` to get the `CSRF` token cookie

To change the default endpoints, please check the [Configuration](/usage/configuration) section.
