## Usage

Composable provides 2 computed properties and 4 methods:

- `user` - currently authenticated user (basically the same as `useSanctumUser`)
- `isAuthenticated` - a boolean flag indicating whether the user is authenticated or not
- `login` - method for logging in the user
- `logout` - method for logging out the user
- `refreshIdentity` - method for manually re-fetching current authenticated user data

To authenticate a user you should pass the credentials payload as an argument to the `login` method.
The payload should contain all fields required by your Laravel Sanctum backend.

```typescript
const { login } = useSanctumAuth();

const userCredentials = {
  email: "user@mail.com",
  password: "123123",
}

await login(userCredentials)
```

If the login operation was successful, the `user` property will be updated with
the current user information returned by the Laravel API.

If you do not want to update the `user` property automatically (e.g. *for 2FA authentication*),
you can disable identity fetching by passing optional argument to `login` method:

```typescript
// user identity will not be loaded after successful response
await login(userCredentials, false) 
```

By default, methods will use the following Laravel endpoints:

- `/login` to authenticate the user
- `/logout` to log out the user
- `/api/user` to get the current user information
- `/sanctum/csrf-cookie` to get the `CSRF` token cookie

To change the default endpoints, please check the [Configuration](/usage/configuration) section.

### Additional `fetch` options

If you want to pass additional header or change HTTP method for either `login` or `logout` calls, 
you can pass optional `options: SanctumFetchOptions` argument.

For example, to log out the user with `DELETE` method instead of default `POST`:

```typescript
const { logout } = useSanctumAuth()

await logout({ method: "DELETE" })
```

Use the same approach when you need to pass additional params to `login` call:

```typescript
const { login } = useSanctumAuth()

const userCredentials = {
  email: "user@mail.com",
  password: "123123",
}

await login(
    userCredentials, 
    false, 
    { headers: { "X-Custom-Header": "header_value" } }
)
```
