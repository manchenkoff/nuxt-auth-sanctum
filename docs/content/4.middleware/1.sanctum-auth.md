## Usage

This middleware checks if the user is authenticated. 
If not, it will redirect a user to the page specified in the `redirect.onAuthOnly` option (default is `/login`).

Also, you might want to remember what page the **user was trying to access** 
and redirect him back to that page after successful authentication. 
To do that, just enable the `redirect.keepRequestedRoute` option and 
it will be automatically stored in the URL for later redirect.

If there is no redirect rule the middleware will throw `403` error.

## Example

This is an example of middleware usage

```vue [app/pages/dashboard.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
definePageMeta({
    middleware: ['sanctum:auth'],
});
</script>

<template>
    <!-- Page for authenticated users only -->
</template>

<style scoped></style>
```
